# Patented-Products-Data-Sets

Organizations and companies performing new product development can access USPTO APIs to determine if patents already exist for particular products or by researchers to determine where R&D dollars should be spent. USPTO APIs are particularly powerful for organizations involved in patent medicine research or innovative product development of any kind.
